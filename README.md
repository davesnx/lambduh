## transform `stdin` with ES6 lambda instead of using `sed`, `jq`, etc. Duh!

My reaction to `jq`: ðŸ¤” *This is cool, but I love ES6. Isn't pure ES6 good enough?*

I think it is.  No new query languages!  No new syntax to learn!  JS Ã¼ber Alles!

## Command

You can use `lambduh` or just `duh`.

## Modes

You may have noticed above that you can apply a transformation to each line.
This is pretty much the only magic built into the `duh` command:
* If the first argument starts with `l` or `L`, it runs in **line mode**.
* Otherwise, it runs in **json mode**.

:star: :+1: **Nice!!** :punch: :sparkles:

### JSON Mode

`JSON.parse`s `stdin`, calls your function on it, writes `JSON.stringify` to `stdout`.  Duh!

### Line Mode

Reads lines from `stdin` one-by-one, calls your function on each with `(text, lineNumber)`, and writes what it returns
to `stdout`, except:

* If your function returns `false`, it quits reading lines.
* If your function returns `null` or `undefined`, it skips to the next line without printing anything.

## Comes with lodash functions built in
