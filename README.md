## transform `stdin` with JS lambda instead of using `sed`, `jq`, etc. Duh!

My reaction to `jq`: ðŸ¤” *This is cool, but I love ES6. Isn't pure ES6 good enough?*

I think it is.  No new query languages!  No new syntax to learn!  JS Ã¼ber Alles!

## Node version note

The syntax that `duh` accepts for your function depends on the version of Node you're running.  If you're running a
really old version, you may not be able to use lambdas, and will have to resort to `function () { return ... }` instead.

## Command

You can use `lambduh` or just `duh`.

## Modes

You may have noticed above that you can apply a transformation to each line of a plain text file.
This is pretty much the only magic built into the `duh` command:
* If the first argument of your function is `lines` (ignoring case), it runs in **lines mode**.
* Otherwise if the first argument of your function starts with `l` or `L`, it runs in **line mode**.
* If the first argument of your function starts with `t` or `T`, it runs in **text mode**.
* Otherwise, it runs in **json mode**.

:star: :+1: **Nice!!** :punch: :sparkles:

### JSON Mode

`JSON.parse`s `stdin`, calls your function on it, writes `JSON.stringify` to `stdout`.  Duh!

### Line Mode

Reads lines from `stdin` one-by-one, calls your function on each with `(text, lineNumber)`, and writes what it returns
to `stdout`, except:

* If your function returns `false`, it quits reading lines.
* If your function returns `null` or `undefined`, it skips to the next line without printing anything.

### Lines Mode

Calls your function with an array of lines from stdin.  If your function returns an array of lines, it writes them
in order to `stdout`.  Otherwise, it calls `String` on it and writes that string to `stdout`.

### Text Mode

Calls your function with the entire text from stdin in a single string, and writes what your function returns to
`stdout`.

## Comes with lodash built in
